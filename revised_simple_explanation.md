**In Simple Terms:**

*   **Documents get automatic 'access tags' based on their specific folder location.** For example, a document in `Docs/HR/StaffOnly/benefits_summary.pdf` gets tags like "HR Department" and "Staff Level Access." The more detailed the folder path (e.g., `Docs/HR/Management/Confidential/strategic_plan.pdf`), the more precise its access requirements become.
*   **People get 'access keys' based on their overall job level (like Manager or Staff), the departments they belong to, any special project teams they're part of, and specific functional roles they might have (like 'Lead' for Project Alpha or 'Reviewer' for HR documents).** A Manager's general key, for instance, will typically also unlock documents accessible to Staff within their specific department, while their functional roles grant more specific access.
*   When someone asks a question, the system first **checks which documents their unique set of keys can unlock.**
*   Then, it **searches for the answer *only* in those permitted documents.** This ensures people only see information they're allowed to access.
