## Handling Folder Restructuring

This section addresses the important considerations and processes required when the folder structure housing documents accessible by the Knowledge Assistant needs to be modified.

### 1. Acknowledging the Dynamic Nature of Folder Structures

Organizational needs are not static; they evolve. As such, the folder structures used to organize documents may need to be updated over time. This can be due to:

*   Evolving business processes or priorities.
*   The initiation, completion, or restructuring of projects.
*   Organizational changes, such as department mergers or splits.
*   General efforts to improve information architecture and findability.

### 2. Impact on Permissions

A core aspect of the Knowledge Assistant's security model is that document metadata (including security tags like department, role-based access levels, and project affiliations) is often derived directly from the folder path in which a document resides.

**Consequence:** Any change to the folder structure—such as renaming a folder, moving a folder to a different location, or deleting a folder—will directly impact the system-generated metadata for all documents within those affected folders. This, in turn, will change the effective access permissions for these documents.

*   **Example:** If a document `annual_report.pdf` is moved from `Docs/Finance/Internal/` to `Docs/Finance/Public/`, the tags derived from its path will change. If "Internal" previously restricted access more than "Public," this move could inadvertently expose the document more broadly if not managed correctly. Conversely, moving a public document into a more restricted folder could inappropriately limit access.

### 3. The Need for a Well-Defined Process

Given the direct link between folder paths and access permissions, it is critical to have a well-defined process for managing folder restructuring. This process must ensure that:

*   Permissions are accurately updated to reflect the new folder locations and intended access policies.
*   There is no unintended loss of legitimate access for users.
*   There is no unintended granting of inappropriate access to sensitive documents.
*   The integrity of the document metadata within the Knowledge Assistant (and its underlying databases like Milvus) is maintained.

### 4. Key Considerations for the Restructuring Process

A robust folder restructuring process should incorporate the following key considerations:

*   **Communication:**
    *   Notify relevant stakeholders well in advance of any planned folder restructuring. This includes users who regularly access the affected documents, department heads, data owners, and project leads.
    *   Explain the reasons for the change, the expected timeline, and any potential (even temporary) impact on access.

*   **Planning:**
    *   Carefully plan the new folder structure. Define the new paths and clearly map out how existing documents and folders will be moved or reorganized.
    *   Consider the permission implications for each part of the new structure. Ensure the new paths will generate the correct security tags according to the established permission rules.

*   **Metadata Re-generation/Re-indexing:**
    *   **Crucial Step:** The Knowledge Assistant system must have a mechanism to re-process all documents in their new locations. This is essential to update the path-based metadata associated with each document.
    *   This re-processing will typically involve:
        *   Detecting the new file paths.
        *   Re-deriving security tags (department, role, project, etc.) based on these new paths.
        *   Updating this metadata in the system's primary metadata store.
        *   Triggering a re-indexing process for the Milvus vector database (or any other search/vector index) to ensure that search results and permission filtering use the updated metadata. Without this, the system might still try to apply old permissions or fail to find documents in searches.

*   **Testing and Verification:**
    *   After the restructuring and metadata regeneration are complete, thoroughly test the system.
    *   Verify that permissions are correctly applied according to the new folder paths. Use representative user profiles from different departments, roles, and project affiliations to confirm they can access what they should and cannot access what they shouldn't.
    *   Check for any broken links or search anomalies.

*   **Minimizing Disruption:**
    *   Whenever possible, schedule significant folder restructuring activities during off-peak hours or maintenance windows to minimize disruption to users.
    *   Communicate any expected downtime clearly.

### 5. Administrative Responsibility

Managing folder restructuring is typically an administrative responsibility. It often requires coordination between:

*   **IT/System Administrators:** Who may manage the file servers, storage systems, and the Knowledge Assistant platform itself, including initiating re-indexing processes.
*   **Data/Content Owners:** Department heads, project leads, or designated content managers who understand the information's sensitivity and intended audience, and who can guide the restructuring to ensure continued appropriate access.

A clear understanding of the permission system's reliance on folder paths is essential for anyone undertaking such a task. Careful planning and execution are key to a successful and secure folder reorganization.
