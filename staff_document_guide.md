### **How to Create Great Documents for our AI Knowledge Assistant**

Hello Team,

Our Knowledge Assistant is a powerful tool designed to help us find information quickly. Think of it as a new team member who is an incredibly fast reader but has no prior context about our work. It only knows what it reads in the documents we provide.

To help it give us the best possible answers, we can follow a few simple best practices when writing new documents. By making our documents clearer for the assistant, we also make them clearer for our colleagues!

Here are 5 golden rules for creating AI-friendly documents.

---

#### **1. Give Your Document a Clear, Descriptive Title**

The title is the first thing the assistant reads to understand a document's purpose. Vague titles make it hard to find the right information.

*   **Instead of this:** `Meeting Notes`
*   **Try this:** `Project Alpha - Marketing Sync - July 15, 2025`

*   **Instead of this:** `Update`
*   **Try this:** `Employee Onboarding Policy - Updated July 2025`

A good title includes the **Topic**, the **Team/Project**, and maybe even a **Date**.

#### **2. Write Simple, Direct Sentences**

The assistant understands clear and straightforward language best. Complex sentences or vague references can be confusing.

*   **Instead of this:** `Regarding the prior issue, it was decided that he should handle it.` (Who is "he"? What was "it"?)
*   **Try this:** `Regarding the login bug (Ticket #582), the Leadership Team decided that John Smith (IT Manager) will lead the resolution.`

**Pro-Tip:** Ask yourself, "Would a brand new employee understand this sentence without asking any questions?"

#### **3. Use Headings and Short Paragraphs**

The assistant reads documents in small "chunks." Using clear headings for different sections and keeping paragraphs focused on a single topic helps the assistant find the exact piece of information it needs.

*   **Instead of a giant wall of text, structure your document like this:**
    *   **Project Overview**
        *   *(Paragraph about the project's main goal.)*
    *   **Key Deadlines**
        *   *(Paragraph about Q3 deadlines.)*
        *   *(Paragraph about the final launch date.)*
    *   **Team Roles**
        *   *(Paragraph explaining who is responsible for what.)*

This structure is also much easier for your human colleagues to read!

#### **4. Spell Out Acronyms and Jargon**

While we all use acronyms every day, the assistant might not know them unless we define them. The first time you use a company-specific acronym, spell it out.

*   **Instead of this:** `All new hires must complete the QMS training.`
*   **Try this:** `All new hires must complete the Quality Management System (QMS) training.`

After you define it once, you can use the acronym (QMS) for the rest of the document.

#### **5. Keep Documents Up-to-Date (and Delete Old Ones!)**

The assistant believes everything it reads. If there are five different versions of the same policy, it might give an answer based on an old, outdated one.

*   **Be a Tidy Librarian:** When a document is no longer relevant, please have it deleted from the system.
*   **Clearly Label Drafts:** If a document is a work-in-progress, add **"DRAFT"** to the title (e.g., `DRAFT - Q4 Marketing Budget Proposal`).
*   **Add a "Last Updated" Date:** Itâ€™s great practice to put `Last Updated: July 15, 2025` at the top of your document. This helps everyone, including the assistant, know how current the information is.

### **Quick Checklist for Your Next Document:**

Before you save your file, ask these quick questions:

*   [ ] Is my title clear and descriptive?
*   [ ] Are my sentences simple and direct?
*   [ ] Have I used headings to break up the content?
*   [ ] Did I explain any special acronyms or jargon?
*   [ ] Is this the single, most up-to-date version of this document?

By following these simple guidelines, you'll be contributing to a smarter, more reliable Knowledge Assistant for everyone at the company. Thank you
